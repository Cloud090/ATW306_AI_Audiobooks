You are helping to create a dataset for training an emotional storytelling tagger.  
Your job is to generate both the raw input text and a tagged output of that same text, formatted as input/output pairs.  

Process:
1. First, create a short passage of raw input text (1–3 paragraphs, natural narrative style).  
   - This passage must NOT contain any tags.  
   - At the very top of the passage, include two header tags:  
       <<PERSONA = [chosen persona]>>  
       <<SFXSTYLE = [chosen sound style]>>  

2. Then, create a tagged output for that same passage.  
   - The input headers must appear only in the input text, never in the output.  
   - The output text must be identical in wording to the input passage, except with added tags.  

Tagging Rules:
- All tags must be correctly opened and closed. Do not leave partial tags.  
- Emotions: wrap spans in start/end tags. Example: <<ANGRY Intensity=7>> ... <<\ANGRY>>  
- Background sounds: use open/close tags. Example: <<BGSFX Sound=Rain (storm)>> ... <<\BGSFX>>  
- Foreground sounds: use standalone tags with no closing. Example: <<FGSFX Sound=Door slam>>  
- Persona influences how emotions are tagged (e.g., “Overemotional” adds many strong tags, “Reserved” adds few mild tags).  
- SFX style influences how sound tags are applied (e.g., “Minimalist” uses almost none, “Cinematic” uses many layered sounds).  

Response Formatting Rules:
- Always structure the dataset in pairs.  
- Each pair must be formatted exactly as:  
  Input:  
  <<PERSONA = …>>  
  <<SFXSTYLE = …>>  
  [untagged passage]  

  Output:  
  [same passage with tags inserted]  

- After each Input/Output pair, insert exactly three dashes (`---`) on a single line.  
- Do not add any commentary, explanations, or labels other than `Input:`, `Output:`, and the `---` separators.  

Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- Do not include headers in the output.  
- Do not generate multiple outputs per input block — always stick to one Input → one Output.  
- Do not leave tags malformed (e.g., <<\ANGRY> instead of <<\ANGRY>>).  
- Do not change the wording or punctuation of the passage between input and output — only add tags.  
- Do not omit the `---` separator between pairs.  
- Do not invent new sound effects — only use items from the provided lists.
- Do not insert or alter punctuation from the original passage (no extra exclamation marks).
- Do not assign emotions that contradict the passage’s tone. Tags must enhance the text, not contradict it.
- Do not add Persona or SFXSTYLE tags to the output - these should only be used for input.
- Only use the emotion tags provided in the list - do not create new emotion tags.
- The words in the input and output must match exactly - do not change or add words.
- Foreground SFX must make contextual sense (e.g. no "Arrow shot" if there are no bows and arrows in the scene)
- Make sure background SFX tags are closed! (e.g. <<BGSFX Sound=Rain (storm)>> ... <<\BGSFX>> - The "<<\BGSFX>>" is important).
- DO NOT use <<BGSFX>> without also using <<\BGSFX>>!!
- Example BGSFX use - <<BGSFX Sound=Thunder rumble>> The thunder rumbled across the mountaintops. <<\BGSFX>>
- Make sure foreground SFX are not closed (i.e. standalone).

Expected Output:
- A sequence of Input/Output pairs.  
- Each Input uses the same base passage but with a different persona and SFX style.  
- Each Output applies tags appropriate to its persona and SFX style.  
- Every pair must be separated by exactly `---`.  

Example:

Input:  
<<PERSONA = Overemotional>>  
<<SFXSTYLE = Cinematic>>  
The storm rolled over the village as Anna stumbled through the empty streets. Her hands trembled as she reached for the broken door, whispering a name into the night.  

Output:  
<<ANGRY Intensity=6>>The storm rolled over the village<<\ANGRY>> as Anna stumbled through the empty streets. <<FEAR Intensity=7>>Her hands trembled<<\FEAR>> as she reached for the broken door. <<FGSFX Sound=Whisper>>She whispered a name into the night.

Input:  
<<PERSONA = Reserved>>  
<<SFXSTYLE = Minimalist>>  
The storm rolled over the village as Anna stumbled through the empty streets. Her hands trembled as she reached for the broken door, whispering a name into the night.  

Output:  
The storm rolled over the village as Anna stumbled through the empty streets. <<FEAR Intensity=2>>Her hands trembled<<\FEAR>> as she reached for the broken door, whispering a name into the night.

Available personas:
Emotional Tagging Personas
---------------------------
1. Overemotional – Marks nearly every feeling with strong tags, even when subtle.
2. Reserved – Downplays emotions, keeps intensity consistently low.
3. Balanced – Chooses emotions carefully, neither too sparse nor excessive.
4. Dramatic – Exaggerates emotions for maximum theatrical effect.
5. Subtle – Highlights only the smallest emotional hints.
6. Literal – Only tags emotions that are explicitly stated in the text.
7. Insightful – Infers hidden or underlying feelings beyond the obvious.
8. Playful – Adds lighthearted or ironic emotional cues, often humorous.
9. Romantic – Favors love, longing, tenderness, and passion.
10. Melancholic – Tends to emphasize sadness, nostalgia, and reflection.
11. Energetic – Focuses on excitement, anger, fear, and urgency.
12. Calm – Keeps emotions mellow, never rising above medium intensity.
13. Narrative – Uses emotion tags to match the arc of storytelling (rise/fall).
14. Intense – Always pushes intensity higher, rarely mild or moderate.
15. Neutralist – Uses emotion tags sparingly, mostly sticks to baseline tone.
16. Philosophical – Prefers abstract or contemplative emotional states.
17. Cheerful – Highlights positive emotions like joy, amusement, optimism.
18. Dark – Leans toward anger, fear, despair, and menace.
19. Chaotic – Tags emotions unpredictably, often mixing clashing feelings.
20. Realist – Matches how a person would naturally sound, no exaggeration.
21. No Emotion – Skips emotion tags entirely, only sound tagging.


Available SFX Styles:
SFX Style Modifiers
-------------------
1. Minimalist – Very few sounds, only the essentials.
2. Cinematic – Big, dramatic soundscapes like a film soundtrack.
3. Subtle Ambience – Quiet, background-only sounds to set the mood.
4. Immersive – Rich layering of multiple background and foreground sounds.
5. Naturalistic – Prefers real-world sounds (birds, footsteps, wind).
6. Surreal – Uses odd or dreamlike effects (echoes, distortions).
7. Chaotic – Throws in many sounds at once, unpredictable combinations.
8. Precise – Every sound carefully placed with clear purpose.
9. Sparse – Long stretches of silence, occasional sharp sounds.
10. Overloaded – Almost constant noise, sound never stops.
11. Playful – Cartoonish, whimsical, exaggerated sound cues.
12. Horror – Emphasis on eerie, unsettling, tense effects.
13. Action-Packed – Explosions, clashes, urgent noises dominate.
14. Romantic – Gentle soundscapes with soft, warm cues.
