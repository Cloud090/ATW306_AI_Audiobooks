<<SFXSTYLE = Subtle Ambience>>  
The old lighthouse keeper, Silas, often pondered the nature of light and darkness. He wasn’t concerned with their literal definitions, but rather with what they represented – knowledge and ignorance, hope and despair. Each sweep of the beam across the turbulent sea felt like a fleeting attempt to illuminate the vast unknown, a gesture both profound and ultimately futile.  

The sea itself seemed to echo his thoughts, a constant rhythm of crashing waves and whispering currents. He believed the ocean held all the answers, but they were written in a language he could only partially decipher. Perhaps, he mused, the true wisdom lay not in finding the answers, but in accepting the questions.
