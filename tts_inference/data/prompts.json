  {
    "text": "<spk=1001> <neutral> Dawn settled slowly across the quiet suburb, brushing pale gold across the rooftops as the first birds began to stir. At number fourteen Willow Lane, a kettle whistled softly inside a kitchen where everything was always exactly where it belonged."
  },
  {
    "text": "<spk=1001> <neutral> Eleanor Marsh folded the corner of the morning newspaper, tapping it twice before setting it beside her untouched cup of tea. She had been awake since before sunrise, listening to the faint hum of distant traffic and waiting for a feeling she could not quite name."
  },
  {
    "text": "<spk=1001> <neutral> Her husband, Thomas, lumbered into the room with the gracelessness that only years of routine could perfect. His slippers scuffed across the tiles as he reached for the kettle, yawning into the sleeve of his robe. \"You’re up early again,\" he murmured, blinking blearily toward the window."
  },
  {
    "text": "<spk=1001> <neutral> Eleanor didn’t answer immediately. Her eyes were fixed on something outside — or perhaps nothing at all. A faint shiver ran along her spine, the kind that comes before a storm you can’t yet see. \"Just couldn’t sleep,\" she finally said, forcing a small smile."
  },
  {
    "text": "<spk=1001> <neutral> The street itself looked perfectly ordinary: trimmed hedges, neat driveways, and the usual scatter of forgotten bicycles on front lawns. But something in the air felt unusually heavy, as if the world were holding its breath for reasons it refused to share."
  },
  {
    "text": "<spk=1001> <neutral> When Thomas finally left for work, Eleanor stood at the doorway longer than usual, watching him reverse the car down the driveway. A faint mist clung to the asphalt, swirling lightly around the tyres like pale smoke."
  },
  {
    "text": "<spk=1001> <neutral> She stepped outside, hugging her cardigan close, and glanced toward the bend in the road — the place where the mail always arrived late, where the neighbours often paused to gossip, and where, this morning, something unfamiliar caught her attention."
  },
  {
    "text": "<spk=1001> <neutral> A tall figure stood at the corner, still as a lamppost, clad in a long grey coat that brushed the ground. Eleanor squinted, certain she had never seen him before. The figure didn’t move, didn’t speak, and didn’t seem the least bit bothered by the cold."
  },
  {
    "text": "<spk=1001> <neutral> For a moment she considered going back inside. But curiosity tugged at her, quiet but insistent. She took a small step forward, then another, feeling the weight of her own heartbeat quicken in her chest."
  },
  {
    "text": "<spk=1001> <neutral> Before she could call out, a sudden breeze swept down the lane, rustling the leaves and lifting the edge of the stranger’s coat. The motion was enough to startle a sparrow nearby into flight, its wings beating sharply against the morning air."
  },
  {
    "text": "<spk=1001> <neutral> And then — without warning — the figure turned its head toward her. Not fast. Not slow. Just deliberate, as though it had been waiting for precisely that moment."
  },
  {
    "text": "<spk=1001> <neutral> Eleanor froze. The stranger’s eyes were a pale, washed-out blue, unsettlingly bright against the muted colours of the morning. Yet there was no malice in them. Only recognition, as though they had met once in a dream long forgotten."
  },
  {
    "text": "<spk=1001> <neutral> Her breath caught in her throat. She opened her mouth to speak, but the figure lifted a hand — a small gesture — and she fell silent. The breeze shifted again, brushing the stranger’s hair back just enough for her to see something glinting near his collar."
  },
  {
    "text": "<spk=1001> <neutral> A small silver pin, shaped like a crescent, gleamed faintly in the light. She didn’t know why, but the sight of it filled her with a sharp, inexplicable sense of déjà vu. She had seen that symbol before. She was sure of it."
  },
  {
    "text": "<spk=1001> <neutral> The stranger lowered his hand, took a single step backward, and then — as easily as a shadow slipping between cracks — he was gone. Not vanished. Just gone. As though he had never been there at all."
  },
  {
    "text": "<spk=1001> <neutral> Eleanor stared helplessly at the empty corner, her hands trembling. A new certainty bloomed inside her, fragile and terrifying: whatever had just happened was only the beginning."
